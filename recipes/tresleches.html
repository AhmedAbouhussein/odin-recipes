            Mexican tres leches cake is a beloved dessert that is known for its rich and indulgent flavors. This classic Mexican dessert consists of a light and fluffy sponge cake that is soaked in a mixture of three milks: evaporated milk, condensed milk, and heavy cream. The cake absorbs the milks, resulting in a moist and tender texture that practically melts in your mouth. Tres leches cake is often topped with whipped cream and garnished with fresh fruit or a sprinkle of cinnamon, adding a touch of sweetness and visual appeal to the dessert. The combination of the moist cake, creamy milk mixture, and delightful toppings make Mexican tres leches cake a true delight for the taste buds.

Whether enjoyed on its own or as part of a festive celebration, Mexican tres leches cake is a culinary masterpiece that delights dessert enthusiasts around the world.

            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Milk mixture:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>1 can (14 ounces) sweetened condensed milk</li>
            <li>1 can (12 ounces) evaporated milk</li>
            <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Topping:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups whipped cream</li>
            <li>Cinnamon powder for dusting (optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.</li>
            <li>In a mixing bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder, and salt.</li>
            <li>In a separate bowl, beat the egg yolks with 3/4 cup of the granulated sugar until pale and creamy.</li>
            <li>Add the milk and vanilla extract to the egg yolk mixture and mix well.</li>
            <li>Gradually add the dry ingredients to the egg yolk mixture and stir until just combined.</li>
            <li>In another bowl, beat the egg whites until soft peaks form. Gradually add the remaining 1/4 cup of granulated sugar and continue beating until stiff peaks form.</li>
            <li>Gently fold the beaten egg whites into the batter until no streaks remain.</li>
            <li>Pour the batter into the prepared baking dish and spread it evenly.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven for about 25-30 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</li>
            <li>While the cake is baking, prepare the milk mixture. In a bowl, whisk together the sweetened condensed milk, evaporated milk, and heavy cream until well combined.</li>
            <li>Once the cake is done, remove it from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes.</li>
            <li>Using a fork or skewer, poke holes all over the surface of the cake.</li>
            <li>Slowly pour the milk mixture over the cake, allowing it to soak in.</li>
            <li>Cover the cake and refrigerate for at least 2 hours or overnight to allow the flavors to meld and the cake to absorb the milks.</li>
            <li>Before serving, spread the whipped cream evenly over the top of the cake.</li>
            <li>Optionally, dust the cake with cinnamon powder for added flavor and decoration.</li>
            <li>Slice and serve chilled. Enjoy the deliciousness of Mexican tres leches cake!</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Note: The cake tastes even better when it's had some time to sit and absorb the milks, so preparing it a day in advance is recommended.</p>
